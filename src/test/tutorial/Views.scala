    * In the Lift IR, arrays are not accessed explicitly but implicitly;

    * the Lift IR and guarantees that data races are avoided by construction
    * since no arbitrary accesses into memory are permitted. However, this
    * introduces two main challenges when compiling the Lift IR:
    *
    * First, avoiding unnecessary intermediate results arising from function which
    * change  only  the  data  layout;
    *
    * And,  secondly,  generating efficient accesses to multi-dimensional arrays
    * which have a flat representation in memory.

    * element and the right neighbor and sum them up to compute a new output element.
    * For the elements at the boundaries, which lack either the left or right neighbor,
    * we specify a boundary handling which determines which elements to use instead.
    * In this case we use the clamping boundary condition which repeats the outermost
